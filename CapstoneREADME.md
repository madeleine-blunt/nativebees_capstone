# Background 
Native bees are the primary pollinator of many American crops [1]. There is estimated to be 4,000 bee species native to the United States [2]. These are subdivided in 7 subfamilies each with a unique role in the United States ecosystem and by edtension - food supply [3].

The National Park Service has been catologuing species of bees and flowering plants that they help pollinate for many years - but there is always more to find! There is a current effort to document and photograph pollinators accross the National Park Service called the "Pollinator Tracker Project" [4].

# Project Objective

This project aims to provide a resource for locating and tracking native bees (as well as flowering plants they may pollinate) across the 63 National Parks as well as the states they inhabit. This will help scientists and explorers alike in the effort of photgraphing and documenting native bees as well as aid in conservation efforts by identifying the enviornments that they most frequently inhabit.
